# Fermat's Last Theorem

An ongoing multi-author open source project to formalise a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem in the Lean theorem prover.

# Information about the project

The project is currently being led by Kevin Buzzard. It is funded by [grant EP/Y022904/1](https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FY022904%2F1), awarded by the UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. The project is hosted at Imperial College London. Kevin would like to extend many many thanks to both of these institutions for their ongoing support of this nonstandard research.

General information ("What is Fermat's Last Theorem/Lean?" / "Why are you doing this?" etc) is [here](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/FLT/blob/main/GENERAL.md).
